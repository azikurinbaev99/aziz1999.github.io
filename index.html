				<h3>basketball</h3>

				<p>Basketball is a great way to get your mind off things and is also a great way to express yourself. It is a sport that can work your whole body. It’s a great pastime for any one and is a great way to bond with friends. I see in my eyes that basketball is very addicting and makes you want to play more and more of it. Basketball is known as a good pastime in many people’s eyes but can also be seen as a passion for many others.</p>

				<p>Learning guitar will always have its challenges, but when each one has been overcome there is the satisfaction of a job well done! It’s always a reminder that success doesn’t happen overnight, and it takes practice and ambition to get there. I spent several months waiting for my skills to materialize. Playing my guitar is an enjoyable and fun skill that I can do just for me</p>

				<h3> skateboarding </h3>

				<p>It's unique, and while skateboarding has grown a ton in popularity over the last few years, there are still piles of people out there who haven't tried it. Skateboarding will challenge you in new ways and teach you a new skill set. Trying new things and gaining new experiences is what keeps your brain alive and active, which in turn gives you new insights into the world and makes you a better, more interesting person!</p>
